Step 1.(Work an example myself)
N = 5
Fib(0)=0;
Fib(1)=1;
Fib(2)=1;
Fib(3)=2;
Fib(4)=3;
Fib(5)=5; 

Step 2. (Write down what I just did)
start from fib(0) 
Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1 
Fib(2) = Fib(0)+Fib(1)=0+1=1;
Fib(3) = Fib(2)+Fib(1)=1+1=2;
Fib(4) = Fib(3)+Fib(2)=2+1=3;
Fib(5) = Fib(4)+Fib(3)=3+2=5;

Step 3. (Generate the steps)
in order to get Fib[N], start from Fib[0] = 0; 
Then apply Fib(i) = Fib(i-2)+Fib(i-1)   Fib(0)=0; Fib(1) =1; (N>=2) to ger Fib[N]

Step 4. Test other values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
When n =0, the number is set to 0, when n = 1, the number is set to 1.

Then when n =2, the value is 0+1 = 1;
When n = 3, the value is 1+1 = 2;
when n = 4, the value is 2+1 = 3;
When n = 5, the value is 3+2 = 5;
When n = 6, the value is 5+3 = 8;
When n = 7, the value is 8+5 = 13;
When n = 8, the value is 13+8 = 21;
