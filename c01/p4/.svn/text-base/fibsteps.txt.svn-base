Step 1: Factorization of 12 is 2*6=2*2*3
        Factorization of 20 is 2*2*2*5
        Factorization of 38 is 2*19

Step 2: The way to find the factorization is check whether 2 is a factor or not, then check 3. As even numbers are not prime, try 3+2 =5 and then try 5+2 = 7.

Step 3: For a number N, check whether 2 is a factor or not, then check 3, 3+2=5, 5+2 =7, the odd numbers. Once find a factor of N, divide N by the factor, and do the previous step again.

Step 4: For 180, 2*90 = 2*2*45 = 2*2*3*15=2*2*3*3*5
        For 210, 2*105 = 2*3*35 = 2*3*5*7
