Classwork 3: Problem 2
----------------------

 1. Open the provided maxSeq.c file and write
    the function:
      int  maxSeq(int * array, int n);
    which returns the length of the maximum increasing subsequence
    in the array (whose length is n).   For example,
    if the array passed in were
   
     { 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6}
  
    this function would return 4 because the longest sequence
    of (strictly) increasing numbers in that array is 1, 3, 5, 7
    which has length 4.


 2. Compile and test your code. 
    We have provided a main function which will print test cases
    and your function's answer for them. You should get
    6, 7, 6, 1, 0, 0.

 3. Commit to svn
