Classwork 5: Problem 2
======================

For this problem, you will use gdb to debug code that I have
provided to you in sqrt.c.   This program is supposed to take
one double as a command line parameter, compute its square root,
and print it out.  It also prints the square root using the standard
library's sqrt function to check its answer.  Unfortunately, its broken.

Use gdb to find and fix the bug(s) in this program.
Devising your own test cases to find the bug(s) is up to you.
