Classwork 5: Problem 4
======================

For this problem, you will be writing a program to count the words
in a file.  We will define a word as a contiguous sequence of
characters for which isalnum returns true (if the character
is a letter or a number).  For example:

  hello42-world !! This__isan example....

has 5 words:

hello42
world

Write a program which takes one or more command line arguments.
For each command line argument given, the program should treat
that argument as the name of a file. If the argument is exactly
two dashes (--), then it should use stdin instead of a file on disk.
The program should output one line per command line argument:
the name of that file (or "stdin") followed by a space, followed
by an integer which is the number of words found in that file.
