- make a struct for a student
      - name (char *)
      - array of class names  (char **)
      - number of classes in that array (int)
main:
  (1) read the file (input) [array of structs]  <-
        - open the file
        - read a number (how many students)    <- 
        - allocate an array of structs
        - Read each student into that array    <-
              - read name
              - read a number
              - allocate memory an array of strings
              - read each classname into that array
  (2) Make an array of all the class names from the input
         - Write a function to see if an array contain a string
         - Iterate over the structs
               - Iterate over the strings inside the structs
                   - Add the unquies ones (not already in the array)
                     to the array
                     (realloc?)
  (3) Write the output class by class
          - Iterate over the array of classname
                  - open/create the appropriate file
                  - search through our students, see which ones 
                     contain that name, and write them into the file
                  - fclose the file
  (4) Free up any memory we allocated
       -iterating over our array of structs
       - iterating over our array of strings
