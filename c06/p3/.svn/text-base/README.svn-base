Classwork 6: Problem 3
======================

***********************************************************
**     REMINDER: starting with Classwork 6, your         **
**  programs  MUST valgrind cleanly for full credit!     **
***********************************************************

For this problem, you will be reworking problem 2 with a slightly
different file format.  This new file format will require you to
use realloc so that you can grow the arrays as needed.

Instead of specifying the number of students and number of courses
in advance, this new format will simply have a blank line to indicate
the end of the classes for a student.   The end of the file indicates
that there are no more students to process:

Student Name 1
Classname 1
Classname 2
...
Classname N

Student Name 2
Classname 1
Classname 2
...
Classname N

Note that your program may either 
 - require a blank line to end the last student's class list
OR
 - accept the input either with our without a blank line at the end
   (where EOF also terminates the last student's class list)
We will only test on inputs which have a blank line to end the input.


Your program should produce the same output (in the same format)
as for p2.  If you used good abstraction, you are likely able to re-use
many functions that you wrote.  As with p2, you should handle errors
by printing a message to stderr and exiting.

Submit your code and Makefile via svn.
