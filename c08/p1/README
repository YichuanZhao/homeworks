Classwork 8, Problem 1
======================

For problems 1 and 2 you will be playing "Pointer Programming Pictionary".

For this game, you need to pair up with a partner.
One p1, one of you will draw what a piece of code does, and the other
will (without seeing the code: only the picture) write down what the picture
your partner draws translates to in code.

For p2, you will switch roles (if you drew on p1, you will write code on p2, 
and vice versa).

When you are writing code:
  You will receive a file called "skeleton.c" which will have type declarations,
  variable declarations, and some basic structure (e.g., some loops) already in it.
  The lines you need to write are replaced with a comment:
   //WRITE ME
  You should be able to write one line of code per comment.
  You will edit this file so that it contains the code corresponding to what your partner draws.

  Note that for things that are in a loop, you might need to see a few iterations to
  figure out the pattern.

When you are drawing:
  You will receive "skeleton.c" (what your partner sees), as well as "code.c"..
  You should look at "skeleton.c" to see what your partner starts with. 
  You should draw out the starting state (main's stack frame, the variables that
  are in the skeleton code, etc), and agree with your partner that this represents
  what they have.
  Then you should draw a line of code, and your partner should write it down.
  You should not describe code verbally or in words, but rather only draw
  boxes and arrows, change numbers in boxes, put strings in boxes, etc.

  (Yes, I realize you could just show them the code, but that defeats the point).
  You can tell your partner if he/she is incorrect, and ask them to try again
  before moving on.  If this happens, you should think carefully about whether
  you drew the right picture and your partner wrote the wrong code, or if you 
  drew the wrong picture.


If you are drawing, you will not submit anything for this segment (you will submit
for p2).   If you are coding, you will submit your skeleton.c file.
